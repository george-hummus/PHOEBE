##### Key to Versions

- v1: Calculates the amplitude in flux units and gives no percentages or run times in info.txt file.
- v2: Calculates amplitude in magnitude units and gives percentages and run times in info.txt file.
- v3 (or new_prototype): Makes all results in CSV output file floats only, fixes issue with going over 90 deg inclination, and the Phoenix atmosphere now works as we use ‘Johnson:I’ passband.



##### Key to CSV files in v3 onward

- Eclipsing?: 0 = no, 1 = yes
- MS Atmosphere Model: 2004 = ck2004, 70 = phoenix (as 0x70 is p)
